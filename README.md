Rick and Morty memory game

Inspired from theodinproject.com

Welcome to my take on a memory game done in React. You're presented with 12
cards, all different from each other. The goal is to not click on the same
character twice. For each unique character you click you get one point. Clicking
on a character you already clicked ends the game and you're presented with your
score and the option to try again How high can you get?
